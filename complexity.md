# Complexity

Algorithms have cost both in run-time and memory usage. Understanding that cost can inform engineers about how the computer is going to perform under a given condition. This performance must then be monitored to determine if the system is achieving the intended goals. When/if the system stops achieving those goals the process needs to be re-run: see what is taking up the time and determine if a different choice can be made and a more suitable algorithm used.

Complexity analysis (at least awareness of it) is how this methodology is executed. Engineering is always a trade off of a number of factors. If a solution is developed quickly using a naive approach because of time/cost then
