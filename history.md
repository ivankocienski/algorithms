# A Brief History of Computers

A whistle-stop tour of the history of computation.


## Pre history

Computers started out as mathematically inclined human beings hired to perform a sequence of operations (an algorithm) to produce an output such as tables. This work was slow, complicated and error prone. In the 1800s engineers felt the need for mechanisation. 

A number of very limited solutions where developed such as Babbage's difference engine, gunnary computers and tabulating machines. Each was developed to solve a specific problem. With the arrival of electrical machines greater speed and compactness could be achieved.

Tabulating machines arrived around the turn of the century and proved a very important point: mechanised calculations can do more work with less errors. These were still electro-mechanical devices that required a lot of set-up and maintenance but they solved a problem that would have been impossible without.

During the early 1900s the field electronics was producing newer and more sophisticated components; the most important part (for this discussion) was the switch. At first electro-mechanical relays, then the vacuum tube and finally the transistor.

## Before electronic Computers

Many mathematicians where exploring the new field of Logic where calculations could be performed entirely by constructing complicated circuits of simpler logical operations. Further- the notions of computability where being defined. Although these machines were purely theoretical there was no reason that they couldn't be built when the technology existed.

The start of the computer industry as it is today was in the development of 'automated calculating machines' to produce those firing tables (the Harvard ENIAC) or analyse coded signals (the Bletchly Collosus). Again- these machines were very simple and could only perform the task they were configured for. One of the key consumers of these machines was the Mahatten nuclear weapon project. Extremely complex mathematical analysis had to be performed to determine the correct geometry of the internal components. It was this growing need to perform various menial tasks that led to what came next.

## Electronic Brains

Digital electronic computers as we know them today came about around 1950 when Von Nueman defined what would be come known as the "von Nueman" architecture. By having a set of well defined components it laid the template for what followed. A computer consisted of; a processing machine, an input device, a work storaqe memory (RAM), a program memory (ROM) and an output device. By engineering the computing device to read and follow instructions from the memory (as opposed to switches and control wires) the machine could perform one set of instructions on one set of data and then perform a different set of instructions on different data. This meant the machine could "reconfigure" itself without any physical change. The age of software had arrived.

## And so on

Modern computers follow many of the same principles as the first machine built. But as these machines grew in capability so did the need for understanding and formalising this new field of software "engineering". The biggest reason for the success of computers is that as they have been refined and imrpoved the need for them has become an indispensible part of modern society. From Air Traffic Control to the Internet human society would not function without these tiny wonders and the culture around them.
